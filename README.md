# ECE FYP - Real Time Strategy Game w/ Natural Language Command & Control
## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a real-time strategy (RTS) game that allows players to control in-game actions through natural language instructions, enabling them to seamlessly perform actions by communicating directly to the game with their own words and enhancing the gameplay immersion and intuitiveness. 
The project involves the implementation of a Unity game and a natural language understanding (NLU) model using RASA conversational chatbot framework that can accurately perceive and interpret high-level intentions from sentences provided by the players. 
It leverages techniques such as machine learning and intent classification to learn and detect high level intents conveyed through the natural language sentences of the player, for instance, to attack, defend, or protect specific units or locations within the game.
